### Description: 
This project is called 'Pixel Art Maker,'
which is a web application that allows the user to color pixels 
on a grid to make various shapes and pictures of any color. 
The grids height and width are specified by the use.

### Purpose:     
To create a drawing app that is easy to use it the browser, fun, and addictive.
It also is great for trying to draw old video game characters (which tended to
be very pixelated). It can also be used by any artist who feels like playing around
with pixel art.

### Contributions:

- Udacity.com created the prompt for the project and wrote the html and css files.

- I created the README.md file, and the javascript file.

### Browsers_Supported:

- Tested on:
	- Google Chrome 
	- Firefox
	- Safari, but
		- Colors need to be inputted via css color name (e.g. blue, red, lime, #008080) rather then the color picker widget supported by Firefox, Google Chrome, and various other browsers
		- For more information on colors in css please read this documentation on [colors supported by css](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)	

- These were the browsers that this application was tested on but feel free to try others

### How To Open the game

- Playable online [here](https://shane-lester99.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/index.html)

### Usage:       
First fill in the height and width form and then click submit. Next, begin to color the pixels on the grid with any color of clients choosing via the color-picker widget. If the client wishes to start over or use a different height/ width combination, fill out the 
height/ width form again and click submit. A blank grid of those dimensions will be provided 

### Build:

- Use git clone on command line to clone this repository.

- Open the index.html in browser of choice. 

### Possible Future Updates:

- Feature to save pictures and creating an account where you can save pictures and share them with others and star them, with a feed of popular ones

- Optimize for touch devices (currently works but UX is slower)
