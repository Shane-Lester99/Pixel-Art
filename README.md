### Description: 
This project is called 'Pixel Art Maker,'
which is a web application that allows the client to color pixels 
on a grid to make various shapes and pictures of any color. 
The grids height and width are specified by the client.

### Purpose:     
Educational. To use Javascript to take a static web page and turn it
into a dynamic web application which can respond to users. Helped to 
solidify knowledge about Javascript syntax, the document object model,
creating html elements and css style with javascript, and working with
browser events.

### Contributions:

Udacity.com created the html and css files. I created the README.md file, and the javascript file.

### Browsers_Supported:

- Tested on:
	- Google Chrome 
	- Firefox
	- Safari, but
		- Colors need to be inputted via css color name (e.g. blue, red, lime, #008080) rather then the color picker widget supported by Firefox, Google Chrome, and various other browsers
		- For more information on colors in css please read this documentation on [colors supported by css](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)	
- These were the browsers that this application was tested on but feel free to try others

### Usage:       
First fill in the height and width form and then click submit. Next, begin to color the pixels on the grid with any color of clients choosing via the color-picker widget. If the client wishes to start over or use a different height/ width combination, fill out the 
height/ width form again and click submit. A blank grid of those dimensions will be provided 

### Build:

- Use git clone on command line to clone this repository.
- Open the index.html in browser of choice. 

### Modifications:
